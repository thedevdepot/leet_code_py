# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to specific target.
# You may assume that each input would be exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# 
# Given nums [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Because num(0) + num(1) = 2 + 7 = 9
# return = [0, 1]
